# SYSC3010 Labs Repository for *Ahmad Alkawasmeh*
## Lab1
Lab1 is about understanding the fundementals of working with the RaspberryPi which consists of: 
 - Flashing the Raspian OS on the SD card and setting up the RaspberryPi by;
 - Interfacing with it through the desktop gui and SSH CLI
 - Learning the basics of using the SenseHAT and running python scripts
 - Grasping the essentials of GitHub commit, push, clone

## Lab4
Lab4 is about learning how to safely add hardware to the Raspberry Pi and becoming familiar with GitHub issue tracking by:
 - Connecting a set of LEDs and a button to the Raspberry Pi through a breadboard
 - Controlling the LEDs and button through a set of GPIO pins 
 - Programming the button to perform a certain functionality when pressed
 - Writing a program to simulate a traffic light and crosswalk button
 - Extending the mini-project repo by creating issues for each team member to work on 
 - Linking a pull request to an issue such that it adds more context to an issue and the code that was changed in relation to it
